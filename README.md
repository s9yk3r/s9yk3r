# Hi, I'm Alessandro L. üëã

![RPG Banner](https://i.imgur.com/TSD2ptp.jpeg?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&q=80)

I'm a 35yo italian **Web Developer** and an aspiring **Game Developer** üéÆüïπÔ∏è.  <br />
I started developing an interest in programming when I was around 23 years old, and since then, I've never stopped exploring and learning! <br />
I am self-taught, and everything I know is the result of years of practice working on relatively complex projects in the world of **Play By Chat role-playing games**. <br />
My biggest dream has always been to become a **videogame developer**, but until now I have never had real opportunities in this regard.  <br />
However, I started exploring **Godot** üëæ a few months ago, although for now I can‚Äôt study it as much as I would like due to my freelance work commitments üí¶.
Currently, I am looking for a more stable job üíº, and in the meantime, I continue to explore and learn!

## üöÄ To give an idea of what I do

- I develop web applications with **PHP**, **Codeigniter**, **JavaScript**, and **Vue.js**
- I currently build text-based RPGs (known as Play By Chat RPGs) for interactive communities  
- I'm currently exploring the art of game development with **Godot**
